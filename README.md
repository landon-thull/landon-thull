I'm a computer science student and programming enthusiast with a thirst for knowledge. Currently, I work for a high-precision manufacturing company where I develop robust internal tools that optimize workflows, mitigate costly errors, and improve overall efficiency. I have an extreme passion for software engineering because it is challenging and there is constant room for improvement.
